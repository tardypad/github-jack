Bugs:
left/center/right is not precise with half/full weeks display

Testing:

Improvements:
- Add README
- describe possible positions in usage

New Features:
- automatically calculate multiplier by looking at user contributions
  as done by https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti/blob/master/gitfiti.py
- add option to start after last commit of the work repo (imply keep or not?)

Discarded:
- option to define value to fill days outside the template
  no meaning in case the the template is larger than one year
  and can be easily done for smaller templates by increasing their size
