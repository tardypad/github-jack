Cleaning:
- add comments for non self explicit parts

Bugs:
left/center/right is not precise with half/full weeks display

Testing:

Improvements:
- follow https://google.github.io/styleguide/shell.xml
- Add README
- Add LICENSE
- autocomplete (for templates and positions)

New Features:
- add option to start after last commit of the work repo (imply keep or not?)

Discarded:
- option to define value to fill days outside the template
  no meaning in case the the template is larger than one year
  and can be easily done for smaller templates by increasing their size
- combine color and username options (same shade multiplier purpose)
  github usernames can be integers too and thus we wouldn't be able to
  differentiate them
