Cleaning:
- split into multiple files?

- separate validate function for each one

Bugs:
left/center/right is not precise with half/full weeks display

Testing:

Improvements:
- Add README
- describe possible positions in usage

New Features:
- add option to start after last commit of the work repo (imply keep or not?)

Discarded:
- option to define value to fill days outside the template
  no meaning in case the the template is larger than one year
