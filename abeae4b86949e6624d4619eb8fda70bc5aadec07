Bugs:
left/center/right is not precise with half/full weeks display

Testing:

Improvements:
- Add README
- Add LICENSE
- autocomplete (for templates and positions)
- add images to visualize the templates as renderered (introduce .tpl extension)
- group templates inside folders (adapt use of template id as parameter)
- add cronjob script example(s) for continuous template

New Features:
- add position option to start after last commit of the work repo

Discarded:
- option to define value to fill days outside the template
  no meaning in case the the template is larger than one year
  and can be easily done for smaller templates by increasing their size
- combine color and username options (same shade multiplier purpose)
  github usernames can be integers too and thus we wouldn't be able to
  differentiate them
- add option to specify spaces after position
  would be useful when adding new template after last one
  but would "require" another option to specify the value to fill those days
  better put the spaces inside the templates themselves

Research:
- use getopt or getopts for parsing inputs
- packaging
- manual
